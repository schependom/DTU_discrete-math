## 4.1 Subgroups

> [!definition] Definition 4.1.1: A subgroup $H$ (p91)
> Let $H \subseteq G$ be a subset of $G$. Then $H$ is called a _subgroup_ of $(G, \cdot)$ if the following properties are satisfied:
>
> 1. $e \in H$ (where $e$ is the identity element of $G$).
> 2. For any $f \in H$, also $f^{-1} \in H$.
> 3. For any $f, g \in H$, also $f \cdot g \in H$.

A subgroup $H \subseteq G$ inherits the group operation $\cdot$ from the larger group $(G, \cdot)$

-   So the group operation in $H$ is the **restriction** of the group operation of $G$
-   The third property in the definition makes sure that this operation sends two elements of $H$ to another element of $H$

> [!lemma] Lemma 4.1.2: When is a subset a subgroup? (p91)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and let $H \subseteq G$ be a **non-empty** subset. Then $$H \text{ is a subgroup of } (G, \cdot) \iff \forall f, g \in H : \boxed{f \cdot g^{-1} \in H}$$

_Example 1_

The set of **even integers**,
$$ \boxed{2\mathbb{Z}} = \{\ldots, -4, -2, 0 = e, 2, 4, \ldots\},$$
is a subgroup of the group of integers $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ according to the above Lemma 4.1.2:

-   Choose $k,\ell \in 2\mathbb{Z}$.
-   Since $k$ and $\ell$ are even numbers, $k - \ell$ is an even number as well.
-   This implies $$k-\ell \in 2\mathbb{Z} \quad \overset{\Delta}{\Leftrightarrow} \quad k \cdot \ell^{-1} \in 2\mathbb{Z} \quad \overset{\text{Lemma 4.1.2}}{\iff} \quad 2\mathbb{Z} \text{ is a subgroup of } (\mathbb{Z}, +)$$

_Example 2_

The cycling group $C_n = \{e, g, g^2, \ldots, g^{n-1}\}$ is a subgroup of the dihedral group $(D_n, \circ)$.\
We can show this by using Definition 4.1.1:

1. The identity element $e$ of $D_n$ is also in $C_n$.
2. If $r^i \in C_n$, then $(r^i)^{-1} = r^{(-i) \bmod n} \in C_n$.
3. If $r^i, r^j \in C_n$, then $r^i \circ r^j = r^{(i+j) \bmod n} \in C_n$.

> [!definition] Definition 4.1.7: The subgroup generated by an element (p92)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and let $g \in G$ be a group element. The set
> $$\gen{g} = \{g^i \mid i \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$
> is a subgroup of $G$, and is said to be the **subgroup generated by $g$**.

Note that $\gen{g}$ is indeed a subgroup, by Definition 4.1.1:

1. $e = g^0 \in \gen{g}$
2. If $f = g^i \in \gen{g}$, then $f^{-1} = (g^i)^{-1} = g^{-i} \in \gen{g}$
3. If $g^i,g^j \in \gen{g}$, then $g^i \cdot g^j = g^{i+j} \in \gen{g}$

> [!lemma] Lemma 4.1.8: Order of the subgroup $\gen{g}$ (p92)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and let $g \in G$ be a group element. Then
> $$|\gen{g}| = \operatorname{ord}(g)$$
> So the order of the subgroup $\gen{g}$ is the same as the order of the element $g$.

## 4.2 Cosets of a group

> [!definition] Definition 4.2.1: Multiplication of subsets (p93)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and let $M \subseteq G$ and $N \subseteq G$ be two subsets of $G$. Then we define
> $$M \cdot N = \{ f \cdot g \mid f \in M, g \in N \}$$

> [!definition] Definition 4.2.3: Left and right cosets (p93)
> Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $(G, \cdot)$ and let $f \in G$ be a group element. Then we define the **left coset of $H$ in $G$ by $f$** as
> $$f \cdot H := \{f\} \cdot H = \{ f \cdot h \mid h \in H \}$$
> Similarly, we define the **right coset of $H$ in $G$ by $f$** as
> $$H \cdot f := H \cdot \{f\} = \{ h \cdot f \mid h \in H \}$$

In an Abelian group, there is **no difference between left and right cosets** since $f \cdot h = h \cdot f$ for any $f,h \in G$.

> [!deduction]
> In an **Abelian** group, we can simply talk about cosets of $H$ in $G$ by $f$, without specifying left or right.

> [!notation] Notation: The set of all cosets of a subgroup in a group (p94)
> The set of **all _left_ cosets of $H$ in $G$** is denoted by
> $$G / H = \{ f \cdot H \mid f \in G \}$$
> Similarly, the set of **all _right_ cosets of $H$ in $G$** is denoted by
> $$H \backslash G = \{ H \cdot f \mid f \in G \}$$
