## 4.1 Subgroups

> [!definition] Definition 4.1.1: A subgroup $H$ (p91)
> Let $H \subseteq G$ be a subset of $G$. Then $H$ is called a _subgroup_ of $(G, \cdot)$ if the following properties are satisfied:
>
> 1. $e \in H$ (where $e$ is the identity element of $G$).
> 2. For any $f \in H$, also $f^{-1} \in H$.
> 3. For any $f, g \in H$, also $f \cdot g \in H$.

A subgroup $H \subseteq G$ inherits the group operation $\cdot$ from the larger group $(G, \cdot)$

-   So the group operation in $H$ is the **restriction** of the group operation of $G$
-   The third property in the definition makes sure that this operation sends two elements of $H$ to another element of $H$

> [!lemma] Lemma 4.1.2: When is a subset a subgroup? (p91)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and let $H \subseteq G$ be a **non-empty** subset. Then $$H \text{ is a subgroup of } (G, \cdot) \iff \forall f, g \in H : \boxed{f \cdot g^{-1} \in H}$$

_Example 1_

The set of **even integers**,
$$ \boxed{2\mathbb{Z}} = \{\ldots, -4, -2, 0 = e, 2, 4, \ldots\},$$
is a subgroup of the group of integers $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ according to the above Lemma 4.1.2:

-   Choose $k,\ell \in 2\mathbb{Z}$.
-   Since $k$ and $\ell$ are even numbers, $k - \ell$ is an even number as well.
-   This implies $$k-\ell \in 2\mathbb{Z} \quad \overset{\Delta}{\Leftrightarrow} \quad k \cdot \ell^{-1} \in 2\mathbb{Z} \quad \overset{\text{Lemma 4.1.2}}{\iff} \quad 2\mathbb{Z} \text{ is a subgroup of } (\mathbb{Z}, +)$$

_Example 2_

The cycling group $C_n = \{e, g, g^2, \ldots, g^{n-1}\}$ is a subgroup of the dihedral group $(D_n, \circ)$.\
We can show this by using Definition 4.1.1:

1. The identity element $e$ of $D_n$ is also in $C_n$.
2. If $r^i \in C_n$, then $(r^i)^{-1} = r^{(-i) \bmod n} \in C_n$.
3. If $r^i, r^j \in C_n$, then $r^i \circ r^j = r^{(i+j) \bmod n} \in C_n$.

> [!definition] Definition 4.1.7: The subgroup generated by an element (p92)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and let $g \in G$ be a group element. The set
> $$\gen{g} = \{g^i \mid i \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$
> is a subgroup of $G$, and is said to be the **subgroup generated by $g$**.

Note that $\gen{g}$ is indeed a subgroup, by Definition 4.1.1:

1. $e = g^0 \in \gen{g}$
2. If $f = g^i \in \gen{g}$, then $f^{-1} = (g^i)^{-1} = g^{-i} \in \gen{g}$
3. If $g^i,g^j \in \gen{g}$, then $g^i \cdot g^j = g^{i+j} \in \gen{g}$

> [!lemma] Lemma 4.1.8: Order of the subgroup $\gen{g}$ (p92)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and let $g \in G$ be a group element. Then
> $$|\gen{g}| = \operatorname{ord}(g)$$
> So the order of the subgroup $\gen{g}$ is the same as the order of the element $g$.

## 4.2 Cosets of a group

> [!definition] Definition 4.2.1: Multiplication of subsets (p93)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and let $M \subseteq G$ and $N \subseteq G$ be two subsets of $G$. Then we define
> $$M \cdot N = \{ f \cdot g \mid f \in M, g \in N \}$$

Note that for $(\Z, +)$, this definition corresponds to the usual addition of sets:
$$M + N = \{ m + n \mid m \in M, n \in N \}$$

> [!definition] Definition 4.2.3: Left and right cosets (p93)
> Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $(G, \cdot)$ and let $f \in G$ be a group element. Then we define the **left coset of $H$ in $G$ by $f$** as
> $$f \cdot H := \{f\} \cdot H = \{ f \cdot h \mid h \in H \}$$
> Similarly, we define the **right coset of $H$ in $G$ by $f$** as
> $$H \cdot f := H \cdot \{f\} = \{ h \cdot f \mid h \in H \}$$

In an Abelian group, there is **no difference between left and right cosets** since $f \cdot h = h \cdot f$ for any $f,h \in G$.

> [!deduction]
> In an **Abelian** group, we can simply talk about cosets of $H$ in $G$ by $f$, without specifying left or right.

> [!notation] Notation: The set of all cosets of a subgroup in a group (p94)
> The set of **all _left_ cosets of $H$ in $G$** is denoted by
> $$G / H = \{ f \cdot H \mid f \in G \}$$
> Similarly, the set of **all _right_ cosets of $H$ in $G$** is denoted by
> $$H \backslash G = \{ H \cdot f \mid f \in G \}$$

## 4.3 Cosets as equivalence classes

> [!definition] Definition 4.3.1: The relation $\sim_H$ (p95)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and $H \subseteq G$ a subgroup. For $f, g \in G$, we write
>
> -   $f \sim_H g \quad\,$ if $\quad f^{-1} \cdot g \in H$
> -   $f \,_H \sim g \quad$ if $\quad g \cdot f^{-1} \in H$

> [!lemma] Lemma 4.3.2: $\sim_H$ and $_H \sim$ are equivalence relations (p95)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and $H \subseteq G$ a subgroup. Then the relations $\sim_H$ and $_H \sim$ are equivalence relations on $G$.

> [!lemma] Lemma 4.3.3 (p95)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and $H \subseteq G$ a subgroup. For $f \in G$ we have
> $$[f]_{\sim_H} = f \cdot H \quad \text{ and } \quad [f]_{_H \sim} = H \cdot f$$

Now that we have identified left and right cosets **of** $H$ **in** $G$ as equivalence classes under $\sim_H$ and $_H \sim$, we can apply Theorem 1.3.3 (Properties of equivalence classes) to these equivalence relations:

> [!theorem] Theorem 4.3.4: Properties of cosets (p96)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and $H \subseteq G$ a subgroup. Then the following holds:
>
> 1. $\forall f \in G$, $f \in f \cdot H$ and $f \in H \cdot f$ (reflexivity).
> 2. We have $G = \bigcup_{f \in G} (f \cdot H) = \bigcup_{f \in G} (H \cdot f)$ ($G$ is covered by all equivalence classes).
> 3. $\forall f,g \in G$,
>     - **either**
>         - $f \cdot H = g \cdot H$
>         - $(f \cdot H) \cap (g \cdot H) = \emptyset$
>     - Similarly, **either**
>         - $H \cdot f = H \cdot g$
>         - $(H \cdot f) \cap (H \cdot g) = \emptyset$.
> 4. $\forall f,g \in G :$
>     - $f \cdot H = g \cdot H \iff f \sim_H g \,\iff f^{-1} \cdot g \in H$
>     - $H \cdot f = H \cdot g \iff f \,_H \sim g \iff g \cdot f^{-1} \in H$.

Since $e \cdot H = \{e \cdot h \mid h \in H\} = H$, we see from part 4 of Theorem 4.3.4 that
$$H = f \cdot H \iff e \cdot H = f \cdot H \iff e \sim_H f \iff e^{-1} \cdot f \in H \iff f \in H$$
and similarly
$$H = H \cdot f \iff H \cdot e = H \cdot f \iff H \,_H \sim f \iff f \cdot e^{-1} \in H \iff f \in H$$

> [!deduction] Deduction: When is a coset equal to the subgroup? (p96)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and $H \subseteq G$ a subgroup. Then for any $f \in G$, we have
> $$f \cdot H = H \iff f \in H \quad \text{ and } \quad H \cdot f = H \iff f \in H$$
> We call an element from a coset a **representative** of that coset.

Below, it is illustrated that **cosets $H \cdot f$ form a partition of the group $G$**:

## 4.4 The order of a subgroup and of an element

> [!theorem] Theorem 4.4.1: the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group (p98)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a _finite_ group and $H \subseteq G$ a subgroup. Then
> $$|H| \text{ divides } |G|$$
> So the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group.

> [!definition] Definition 4.4.2: index of a subgroup in a group (p98)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and $H \subseteq G$ a subgroup. The number of left (or right) cosets of $H$ in $G$ is denoted by
> $$[G : H] = |G / H|$$
> and is called the **index of $H$ in $G$**

> [!proposition] Proposition 4.4.4: order of a group element (p98)
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a _finite_ group and let $g \in G$ be a group element. Then
> $$\operatorname{ord}(g) \text{ divides } |G|$$
> In particular, we have
> $$\forall g \in G: g^{|G|} = e$$

Proposition 4.4.4 has a number of intereseting consequences for specific groups.

We start with **Euler's theorem**:

> [!corollary] Corollary 4.4.6: Euler's theorem (p99)
> Let $d,n \in \Z$ be two integers and assume that $\gcd(d,n) = 1$. Then
> $$d^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod n$$
> where $\phi(n)$ is Euler's totient function defined by $\phi(n) = |(\Zn)^*|$.

In case $n$ is a prime number $p$, we have
$$\phi(p) = |\{i \in \{1, \ldots, p-1\} \mid \gcd(i,p) = 1\}| = p-1$$
This gives us the following special case of Euler's theorem, known as **Fermat's little theorem**:

> [!corollary] Corollary 4.4.7: Fermat's little theorem (p99)
> Let $p$ be a prime number and let $d \in \N$ such that $p \nmid d$. Then
> $$d^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod p$$
