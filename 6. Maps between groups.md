$$h = g \cdot_1 f \qquad \text{and} \qquad \psi(h) = \psi(g) \cdot_2 \psi(f)$$

Note how similar the definition of a group **homomorphism** is to the definition of a group **action** (Def. 5.1.1).

> [!example] Example 6.1.5: A group action is a group homomorphism
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group with identity element $e_1$ that acts on the set $A$ via $\varphi : G \to S_A$.
>
> -   Since $\varphi_{e_1} = \text{id}_A$ and $\text{id}_A = e_2$ is the identity element of $S_A$, we have $\varphi(e_1) = e_2$.
> -   For any $f,g \in G$ we have $\varphi_{g \cdot f} = \varphi_g \circ \varphi_f$ by definition of a group action.
>     Since $\circ = \cdot_2$ is the group operation in $S_A$, we have $\varphi(g \cdot f) = \varphi(g) \cdot_2 \varphi(f)$.
>
> We conclude: **any group action $\varphi : G \to S_A$ is a group homomorphism on $S_A$**

Lemma 5.1.2 (group actions preserve inverses) can be generalized to any group **homomorphism**:

> [!lemma] Lemma 6.1.6: Group homomorphisms preserve inverses
> Let $\psi : G_1 \to G_2$ be a group homomorphism. Then for any $f \in G_1$ we have
> $$\boxed{\psi(f^{-1}) = (\psi(f))^{-1}}$$

> [!definition] Definition 6.1.7: Kernel of a group homomorphism
> Let $\psi : G_1 \to G_2$ be a group homomorphism and let $e_2$ be the identity element of $G_2$.
> Then we define the **kernel** of $\psi$ as
> $$\boxed{\ker(\psi) := \{ g \in G_1 \mid \psi(g) = e_2 \}}$$

> [!fact] Kernel of $\psi : G_1 \to G_2$ always contains the identity element of $G_1$
> Since $\psi$ is a group homomorphism, we have $\psi(e_1) = e_2$. Therefore $$e_1 \in \ker(\psi)$$

If the kernel only contains the identity element, the homomorphism $\psi$ is injective:

> [!lemma] Lemma 6.1.8: Injectivity and kernel
> Let $\psi : G_1 \to G_2$ be a group homomorphism. Then $$\boxed{\psi \text{ is injective} \iff \ker(\psi) = \{ e_1 \}}$$

> [!fact] Group <u>iso</u>morphisms have trivial kernel
> If $\psi : G_1 \to G_2$ is a group **iso**morphism, then $\psi$ is bijective and therefore injective.
> By Lemma 6.1.8, we have $$\ker(\psi) = \{ e_1 \}$$

> [!theorem] Theorem 6.1.9: Kernel is a subgroup
> Let $\psi : G_1 \to G_2$ be a group homomorphism. Then $$\ker(\psi) \subseteq G_1 \text{ is a subgroup of } G_1$$
> Moreover,
> $$\forall f \in G_1 : \qquad \boxed{f \cdot_1 \ker(\psi) = \ker(\psi) \cdot_1 f}$$
> In other words, the kernel is a **normal subgroup** of $G_1$ (Def. 6.1.10).

> [!definition] Definition 6.1.10: Normal subgroup
> A subgroup $H$ of a group $(G, \cdot)$ is called a **<u>normal</u> subgroup** if
> $$\forall f \in G : \qquad \boxed{f \cdot H = H \cdot f}$$
> In other words, all left cosets of $H$ are equal to the corresponding right cosets.

> [!deduction] The kernel is a normal subgroup
> It follows directly from Theorem 6.1.9 and Definition 6.1.10 that the **kernel** of any group homomorphism $\psi : G_1 \to G_2$ is a **normal** subgroup of $G_1$.

## 6.2 Quotient groups

We will show that a **normal** subgroup (with left cosets = right cosets) $H \subseteq G$ of a group $(G, \cdot)$ can be used to construct a new group, called the **quotient group** $G/H$.

> [!definition] Definition 6.2.1:
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and $H \subseteq G$ be a **normal** subgroup of $G$ we define
> $$\boxed{G/H := \{ f \cdot H \mid f \in G \}} = \{ H \cdot f \mid f \in G \}$$
> as the **set of all cosets** of $H$ in $G$.
> Its size $|G/H|$ is called the **index** of $H$ in $G$ and denoted by $[G : H]$.

Using multiplication of subsets (Def. 4.2.1), we can define a **group operation** $\cdot$ on $G/H$:$$(fH) \cdot (gH) := \{k \cdot \ell \mid k \in fH, \ell \in gH\}$$where $fH, gH \in G/H$.

> [!definition] Definition 6.2.2
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and $H \subseteq G$ be a _normal_ subgroup of $(G, \cdot)$.
> Let $C,D \in G/H$ be two cosets of $H$ in $G$.
> Suppose that $f \in C$ and $g \in D$ are arbitrary representatives of $C$ and $D$, respectively.
>
> We define the **product** of the cosets $C$ and $D$ as
> $$C \cdot D := (f \cdot g)H$$
> Note that this coset is independent of the choice of representatives $f$ and $g$.

> [!notation] Notation: representatives of cosets
> If $C \in G/H$ is a coset of the normal subgroup $H$ in $G$, then any $f \in C$ is called a **representative** of the coset $C$.

> [!definition] Restated Definition 6.2.2
> If $f$ is a representative of a coset $C \in G/H$ and $g$ is a representative of a coset $D \in G/H$, then $C \cdot D$ is again a coset of $H$ in $G$ (and thus $C \cdot D \in G/H$) and $f \cdot g$ is a representative of $C \cdot D$.

> [!definition] Definition 6.2.3: Quotient group
> Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group, $H \subseteq G$ a **normal** subgroup of $G$ and $G/H$ the set of all cosets of $H$ in $G$ (Def. 6.2.1). Then the multiplication of cosets$$(fH) \cdot (gH) := (f \cdot g)H \quad \textit{(Def. 6.2.2)}$$ gives rise to a **group structure** on $(G/H, \cdot)$.
