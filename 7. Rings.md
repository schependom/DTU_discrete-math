## 7.1 Definition of a ring

> [!definition] Definition 7.1.1
> A **ring** $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ is a set $R$ equipped with **two** binary **operations** > $$+_R : R \times R \to R \qquad \text{and} \qquad \cdot_R : R \times R \to R$$
> such that the following axioms hold:
>
> 1. $(R, +_R)$ is an **abelian group** (the _additive_ group). The identity element of this group is denoted by $0_R$.
> 2. There exists an **identity element** $1_R$ for the operation $\cdot_R$ such that for all $x \in R$, we have
>    $$x \cdot_R 1_R = 1_R \cdot_R x = x.$$
> 3. The operation $\cdot_R$ is **associative**: for all $x, y, z \in R$, we have
>    $$(x \cdot_R y) \cdot_R z = x \cdot_R (y \cdot_R z).$$
> 4. The operations $+_R$ and $\cdot_R$ satisfy the **distributive laws**: for all $x, y, z \in R$, we have
>    $$x \cdot_R (y +_R z) = (x \cdot_R y) +_R (x \cdot_R z)$$
>    and
>    $$(x +_R y) \cdot_R z = (x \cdot_R z) +_R (y \cdot_R z).$$

> [!exercise] Ex. 7.11: Identity elements
> The only ring in which $1_R = 0_R$ is the zero-ring $(\{0_R\}, +_R, \cdot_R)$.

It is **not** necessary to assume that $(R, +_R)$ is an **abelian** group: If $(R, +_R)$ is a non-necessarily-abelian group, then the other ring axioms would imply that for all $x, y \in R$, $x +_R y = y +_R x$.

> [!exercise] Ex. 7.11
> Let $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ be a ring. Then
>
> 1. $\forall x \in R :\quad \boxed{x \cdot_R 0_R = 0_R \cdot_R x = 0_R}$
> 2. $\boxed{0_R \neq 1_R} \quad$ unless $R$ is the zero-ring $(\{0_R\}, +_R, \cdot_R)$.

> [!exercise] Ex. 7.15
> Let $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ be a ring. Then
>
> -   $\forall u \in R : \quad \boxed{-u = (-1_R) \cdot_R u = u \cdot_R (-1_R)}$
> -   $\boxed{u \in R^* \implies -u \in R^*}$ (if $u$ is a unit, then so is $-u$)

> [!definition] Commutative ring
> A ring $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ is called a **commutative ring** if the operation $\cdot_R$ is commutative.

Examples of commutative rings are $(R, +, \cdot)$ where $R \in \{\Z, \Q, \R, \C\}$.

> [!definition] Definition 7.1.5: Units and the set $R^*$ of units
> Let $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ be a ring. An element $x \in R$ is called a **unit** if there exists an element $y \in R$ such that
> $$x \cdot_R y = y \cdot_R x = 1_R.$$
> The set of all units in $R$ is denoted by $R^*$:
> $$\boxed{R^* := \{ x \in R \mid \exists y \in R : x \cdot_R y = y \cdot_R x = 1_R \}}$$

In other words: the set $R^*$ consists of all elements $x$ from $R$ having a multiplicative inverse.
Just as for groups, multiplicative inverses (if they exist) are unique and one writes $x^{-1}$ for this
inverse.

> [!lemma] Lemma 7.1.6: The group $(R^*, \cdot_R)$
> Let $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ be a ring. Then
> $$\boxed{(R^*, \cdot_R) \textbf{ is a group}} \text{ with identity element } 1_R.$$

_Example_: consider the ring $(\Z_6, +_6, \cdot_6)$. The units in this ring are $1$ and $5$.

We already showed in Chapter 3 that $(\Z_6, \cdot_6)$ is not a group, because $2, 3, 4$ do not have multiplicative inverses. However, we defined the group $((\Z_n)^*, \cdot_n)$ in Chapter 3 with
$$(\Z_n)^* = \{ z \in \Z_n \mid \gcd(z, n) = 1 \}.$$
Now we see that this group is precisely the group of units of the ring $(\Z_n, +_n, \cdot_n)$:
$$(\Z_n)^* = \Z_n^*.$$
So, for the ring $(\Z_6, +_6, \cdot_6)$, we have $\Z_6^* = \{1, 5\}$.

> [!definition] Definition 7.1.11: Zero-divisor
> Let $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ be a ring. An element $x \in R$ is called a **zero-divisor** if
> $$ x\neq 0_R \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{\exists y \in R \setminus \{0_R\} : x \cdot_R y = 0_R \, \lor \, y \cdot_R x = 0_R}$$

**WARNING**: For rings $R$ with at least one zero-divisor, then
$$\boxed{x \cdot_R y = 0_R \quad \centernot\implies \quad x = 0_R \, \lor \, y = 0_R}$$
This **cancellation rule** only holds in rings without zero-divisors, i.e. in **integral domains**!

> [!deduction]
> A ring has **no zero-divisors** if and only if for all $x, y \in R$,
> $$(x \neq 0_R \land y \neq 0_R) \implies (x \cdot_R y \neq 0_R).$$
> or equivalently,
> $$(x \cdot_R y) = 0_R \implies (x = 0_R \lor y = 0_R).$$

> [!proposition] Proposition 7.1.15
> Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $a \in \Z_n$ be an element different from 0.
> Then **exactly one** of the following two statements is true:
>
> 1. $a$ is a zero-divisor $\iff \gcd(a, n) > 1$.
> 2. $a$ is a unit $\iff \gcd(a, n) = 1$.

> [!exercise] Ex. 7.16: The characteristic of a ring
> Let $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ be a ring. The **characteristic** of $R$ is defined as the smallest positive integer $n$ such that
> $$\underbrace{1_R +_R 1_R +_R \cdots +_R 1_R}_{n \text{ times}} = 0_R.$$
> and is denoted by
> $$\text{char}(R) := n.$$
> If this sum never reaches the identity element $0_R$, then the ring has **characteristic zero**, like for example $\text{char}(\Z) = 0.$

> [!exercise] Ex. 7.16: Boolean rings
> A ring $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ is called a **Boolean ring** if for all $r \in R$, we have
> $$r \cdot_R r = r^2 = r.$$
> Every boolean ring is commutative and we can define
> $$x \land y := x \cdot_R y, \quad x \lor y := x +_R y +_R (x \cdot_R y), \quad \neg x := 1_R +_R x.$$
> Boolean rings have characteristic 2, since $1_R = -1_R \implies \underbrace{1_R +_R 1_R}_{2 \text{ times}} = 0_R$.

## 7.2 Domains and fields

> [!definition] Integral domain
> An **integral domain** is a **commutative** ring $(R, +, \cdot)$ with **no zero-divisors**.

Examples of integral domains are $(R, +, \cdot)$ where $R \in \{\Z, \Q, \R, \C\}$.

Note that we now leave out the $R$ subscripts for the operations $+$ and $\cdot$ when there is no risk of confusion.

> [!proposition] Proposition 7.2.1
> Let $(R, +, \cdot)$ be an (integral) domain (i.e. a commutative ring without zero-divisors).
> $$x \cdot y \implies \boxed{x = 0 \lor y = 0}$$
> Consequently,
> $$\boxed{x \cdot y = x \cdot z \quad \land \quad x \neq 0 \quad \implies \quad y = z}$$

Because of the above proposition, domains are said to **satisfy the _cancellation law_**.

> [!definition] Definition 7.2.4: Field
> Let $(R, +, \cdot)$ be a commutative ring such that
> $$\boxed{R^* = R \setminus \{0\}}$$.
> Then $(R, +, \cdot)$ is called a **field**.

Examples of fields are $(R, +, \cdot)$ where $R \in \{\Q, \R, \C\}$.
Note that $(\Z, +, \cdot)$ is **not a field** because not every non-zero integer has a multiplicative inverse in $\Z$! In fact, $\Z^* = \{1, -1\} \neq \Z \setminus \{0\}$.

> [!fact] Fields
> If $(R, +, \cdot)$ is a field, then
>
> 1. every $x \in R \setminus \{0\}$ admits a multiplicative inverse for $\cdot_R$
> 2. $(R \setminus \{0\}, \cdot_R)$ is a group

In fact, $(R \setminus \{0\}, \cdot_R)$ is an abelian group because the ring is commutative!

_Why are fields always integral domains?_

> Assume that $(R, +, \cdot)$ is a field and let $x, y \in R$ such that $$x \cdot y = 0$$If $x \neq 0$, then $x$ is a unit (by definition of a field) and thus has a multiplicative inverse $x^{-1}$. Multiplying both sides of the equation $x \cdot y = 0$ by $x^{-1}$ gives $$x^{-1} \cdot (x \cdot y) = x^{-1} \cdot 0 \implies 1 \cdot y = 0 \implies y = 0.$$Because there exists no $y \neq 0$ such that $x \cdot y = 0$, we conclude that $x$ is not a zero-divisor. By symmetry, the same argument applies if $y \neq 0$. Therefore, a field has no zero-divisors and is thus an integral domain.

**WARNING**:$$\boxed{(\Z_n, +_n, \cdot_n) \text{ is a field} \iff n \text{ is a prime number.}}$$

> [!defintion] Finite field
> A **finite field** is a field with a finite number of elements.

> [!notation] Finite field with $p$ elements
> Let $p$ be a prime number. The **finite** field $\Z_p$ with $p$ elements is denoted by
> $$(\Z_p, +_p, \cdot_p) = \boxed{(\F_p, +_p, \cdot_p) = (\text{GF}(p), +_p, \cdot_p)}$$
> where $\text{GF}(p)$ stands for **Galois Field** (_Évariste Galois_).

We write $\F_p$ instead of $\Z_p$ to emphasize that it is a **field** rather than just a ring.

_Why is $(\Z_p, +_p, \cdot_p)$ a field?_ Because if $p$ is a prime, $$\begin{align}\Z_p^* &= \{p \in \Z_p \mid \text{gcd}(p, n) = 1\} \\ &= \Z_p \setminus \{0\} &&\text{because the only divisor of } p \text{ is } 1 \text{ and } p \text{ itself.}\end{align}$$ so every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse and thus $\Z_p$ is a field.

## 7.3 Polynomials with coefficients in a commutative ring

We will assume that $$(R, +_R, \cdot_R) \text{ is a } \textbf{commutative ring}.$$

> [!definition] Definition 7.3.1: Polynomial with coefficients in $R$
> Let $(R, +, \cdot)$ be a (commutative) ring. A **polynomial $p(X)$ with coefficients in $R$** is a formal expression of the form
> $$p(X) = r_0 + r_1 X + r_2 X^2 + \cdots + r_d X^d$$
> where $d \in \Z_{\geq 0}$ and $r_0, r_1, \ldots, r_d \in R$.
>
> -   The ring elements $r_0, r_1, \ldots, r_d$ are called the **coefficients** of the polynomial $p(X)$,
> -   $X$ is called the **indeterminate** of the polynomial.
>
> If $r_d \neq 0$, then the **degree** of $p(X)$ is defined as
> $$\deg(p(X)) = d,$$
> and $r_d$ is called the **leading coefficient**.

> [!definition] Monic polynomial
> A polynomial $p(X) \in R[X]$ is called **monic** if its leading coefficient is $1_R$.

> [!definition] Zero polynomial
> If $p(X) = 0_R$, then $p(X)$ is called the **zero polynomial** and its degree is defined as
> $$\deg(0_R) = -\infty.$$

> [!definition] Set of polynomials $R[X]$
> The **set of all polynomials** with coefficients in the ring $R$ is denoted by
> $$\boxed{R[X]} := \{ p(X) \mid p(X) \text{ is a polynomial with coefficients in } R \}.$$

For $a \in R$ and $p(X) = r_0 + r_1 X + r_2 X^2 + \cdots + r_d X^d \in R[X]$, we define the **evaluation** of $p(X)$ at $a$ as
$$p(a) = r_0 + r_1 a + r_2 a^2 + \cdots + r_d a^d \in R$$

A polynomial is **uniquely determined by its coefficients**. In other words, two polynomials $p(X) = \sum_{i=0}^d r_i X^i$ and $q(X) = \sum_{i=0}^e s_i X^i$ are equal if and only if $d = e$ and $r_i = s_i$ for all $i = 0, 1, \ldots, d$.

We can give a ring structure to $R[X]$ by defining addition and multiplication of polynomials.

> [!definition] Definition 7.3.4: Addition and multiplication of polynomials
> Let $p(X), q(X) \in R[X]$ be two polynomials defined as
> $$p(X) = \sum_{i=0}^d r_i X^i \quad \text{and} \quad q(X) = \sum_{i=0}^e s_i X^i.$$
> The **sum** $p(X) + q(X)$ and the **product** $p(X) \cdot q(X)$ are defined as follows:
>
> $$
> \begin{align}
> p(X) + q(X) &= \sum_{\ell=0}^{\max(d, e)} (r_\ell + s_\ell) X^\ell \\
> p(X) \cdot q(X) &= \sum_{\ell=0}^{d+e} \left( \sum_{i=0}^{\ell} r_i s_{\ell-i} \right) X^\ell
> \end{align}
> $$

For example, $$(r_i X^i) \cdot (s_j X^j) = (r_i \cdot s_j) X^{i+j},$$but it is **not** always true that $$\deg(p(X) \cdot q(X)) = \deg(p(X)) + \deg(q(X)).$$This, in fact, **does** hold if $R$ is an integral domain (Theorem 7.3.7).

> [!definition] Definition 7.3.5: The polynomial ring $(R[X], +, \cdot)$
> Let $(R, +, \cdot)$ be a commutative ring and let $R[X]$ be the set of all polynomials with coefficients in $R$. Then the following holds:
>
> $(R[X], +, \cdot)$ equipped with the addition and multiplication of polynomials from Definition 7.3.4 is a ring, called the **polynomial ring in the indeterminate $X$ and coefficients in $R$**.

> [!theorem] Theorem 7.3.6: The polynomial ring $D[X]$ over a domain $D$ is a domain
> Let $(D, +, \cdot)$ be an integral **domain**. Then
> $$(D[X], +, \cdot) \text{ is an integral} \textbf{ domain as well}$$

A consequence of this theorem is the following:

> [!corollary] Corollary 7.3.7: Degrees of products of polynomials over a domain
> Let $(D, +, \cdot)$ be an integral domain and let $p(X), q(X) \in D[X]$ be two non-zero polynomials. Then
> $$\boxed{\deg(p(X) \cdot q(X)) = \deg(p(X)) + \deg(q(X))}$$

## 7.4 Division with remainder for polynomials

> [!theorem] Theorem 7.4.1: Division with remainder for polynomials over a commutative ring
> Let $(R, +, \cdot)$ be a commutative ring and let $p(X), q(X) \in R[X]$ be two polynomials different from zero. Assume that $d(X)$ is monic (i.e. its leading coefficient is $1_R$). Then there exist polynomials $q(X), r(X) \in R[X]$ such that
>
> 1. $p(X) = d(X) \cdot q(X) + r(X)$
> 2. $\deg(r(X)) < \deg(d(X))$

We defined the degree of the zero polynomial as $-\infty$ so that the condition $\deg(r(X)) < \deg(d(X))$ automatically holds.

The proof of this theorem gives an algorithm to compute the quotient and remainder polynomials $q(X)$ and $r(X)$. When performing this **division algorithm**, one ends up with a schematic following the following form:

![[images/7/division-algorithm.jpg]]

> [!definition] Root of a polynomial
> Let $(R, +, \cdot)$ be a commutative ring and let $p(X) \in R[X]$ be a polynomial. An element $a \in R$ is called a **root** of the polynomial $p(X)$ if
> $$\boxed{p(a) = 0_R}$$
> In other words, $a$ is a root of $p(X)$ if and only if $p(X)$ evaluates to $0_R$ in $a$.

The division algorithm relates the notions on _evaluation_ and _root_ to a specific way to write (factor) a polynomial.

> [!proposition] Proposition 7.4.3: Roots and factors of polynomials
> Let $(R, +, \cdot)$ be a commutative ring and let $p(X) \in R[X]$ be a _non-zero_ polynomial of degree $\deg(p(X)) = n \geq 1$. Then there exists a polynomial $q(X) \in R[X]$ of degree $\deg(q(X)) = n - 1$ such that
> $$\boxed{p(X) = (X - a) \cdot q(X) + p(a)}$$
> Moreover, $a \in R$ is a **root** of $p(X)$ if there xists a polynomial $q(X) \in R[X]$ such that
> $$\boxed{p(X) = (X - a) \cdot q(X)}$$

> [!corollary] Corollary 7.4.4: Number of roots of a polynomial over a domain
> Let $(D, +, \cdot)$ be an integral **domain** and let $p(X) \in D[X]$ be a non-zero polynomial of degree $\deg(p(X)) = n \geq 1$. Then $$\boxed{p(X) \text{ has at most $n$ distinct roots in $D$}}$$

Since Corollary 7.4.4 holds for any integral **domain**, it also holds for **fields**, since fields are integral domains, but it is in general **not** true if $(D, +, \cdot)$ has zero-divisors (and thus is not an integral domain).

_Example_: consider $2X \in \Z_4[X]$. This polynomial has degree 1, but it has two distinct roots in $\Z_4$, namely $0$ and $2$, since $2 \cdot 0 = 0$ and $2 \cdot 2 = 4 \equiv 0 \mod 4$.
