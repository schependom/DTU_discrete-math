## 7.1 Definition of a ring

> [!definition] Definition 7.1.1
> A **ring** $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ is a set $R$ equipped with **two** binary **operations** > $$+_R : R \times R \to R \qquad \text{and} \qquad \cdot_R : R \times R \to R$$
> such that the following axioms hold:
>
> 1. $(R, +_R)$ is an **abelian group**. The identity element of this group is denoted by $0_R$.
> 2. There exists an **identity element** $1_R$ for the operation $\cdot_R$ such that for all $x \in R$, we have
>    $$x \cdot_R 1_R = 1_R \cdot_R x = x.$$
> 3. The operation $\cdot_R$ is **associative**: for all $x, y, z \in R$, we have
>    $$(x \cdot_R y) \cdot_R z = x \cdot_R (y \cdot_R z).$$
> 4. The operations $+_R$ and $\cdot_R$ satisfy the **distributive laws**: for all $x, y, z \in R$, we have
>    $$x \cdot_R (y +_R z) = (x \cdot_R y) +_R (x \cdot_R z)$$
>    and
>    $$(x +_R y) \cdot_R z = (x \cdot_R z) +_R (y \cdot_R z).$$

It is **not** necessary to assume that $(R, +_R)$ is an **abelian** group: If $(R, +_R)$ is a non-necessarily-abelian group, then the other ring axioms would imply that for all $x, y \in R$, $x +_R y = y +_R x$.

> [!definition] Commutative ring
> A ring $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ is called a **commutative ring** if the operation $\cdot_R$ is commutative.

> [!definition] Definition 7.1.5: Units and the set $R^*$ of units
> Let $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ be a ring. An element $x \in R$ is called a **unit** if there exists an element $y \in R$ such that
> $$x \cdot_R y = y \cdot_R x = 1_R.$$
> The set of all units in $R$ is denoted by $R^*$:
> $$\boxed{R^* := \{ x \in R \mid \exists y \in R : x \cdot_R y = y \cdot_R x = 1_R \}}$$

In other words: the set $R^*$ consists of all elements $x$ from $R$ having a multiplicative inverse.
Just as for groups, multiplicative inverses (if they exist) are unique and one writes $x^{-1}$ for this
inverse.

> [!lemma] Lemma 7.1.6: The group $(R^*, \cdot_R)$
> Let $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ be a ring. Then
> $$\boxed{(R^*, \cdot_R) \textbf{ is a group}} \text{ with identity element } 1_R.$$

_Example_: consider the ring $(\Z_6, +_6, \cdot_6)$. The units in this ring are $1$ and $5$.

We already showed in Chapter 3 that $(\Z_6, \cdot_6)$ is not a group, because $2, 3, 4$ do not have multiplicative inverses. However, we defined the group $((\Z_n)^*, \cdot_n)$ in Chapter 3 with
$$(\Z_n)^* = \{ z \in \Z_n \mid \gcd(z, n) = 1 \}.$$
Now we see that this group is precisely the group of units of the ring $(\Z_n, +_n, \cdot_n)$:
$$(\Z_n)^* = \Z_n^*.$$
So, for the ring $(\Z_6, +_6, \cdot_6)$, we have $\Z_6^* = \{1, 5\}$.

> [!definition] Definition 7.1.11: Zero-divisor
> Let $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ be a ring. An element $x \in R$ is called a **zero-divisor** if
> $$ x\neq 0_R \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{\exists y \in R \setminus \{0_R\} : x \cdot_R y = 0_R \, \lor \, y \cdot_R x = 0_R}$$

**WARNING**: For rings $R$ with at least one zero-divisor, then
$$\boxed{x \cdot_R y = 0_R \quad \centernot\implies \quad x = 0_R \, \lor \, y = 0_R}$$

> [!deduction]
> A ring has **no zero-divisors** if and only if for all $x, y \in R$,
> $$(x \neq 0_R \land y \neq 0_R) \implies (x \cdot_R y \neq 0_R).$$
> or equivalently,
> $$(x \cdot_R y) = 0_R \implies (x = 0_R \lor y = 0_R).$$

> [!proposition] Proposition 7.1.15
> Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $a \in \Z_n$ be an element different from 0.
> Then **exactly one** of the following two statements is true:
>
> 1. $a$ is a zero-divisor $\iff \gcd(a, n) > 1$.
> 2. $a$ is a unit $\iff \gcd(a, n) = 1$.

## 7.2 Domains and fields

> [!definition] Integral domain
> An **integral domain** is a **commutative** ring $(R, +, \cdot)$ with **no zero-divisors**.

Note that we now leave out the $R$ subscripts for the operations $+$ and $\cdot$ when there is no risk of confusion.

> [!proposition] Proposition 7.2.1
> Let $(R, +, \cdot)$ be an (integral) domain (i.e. a commutative ring without zero-divisors).
> $$x \cdot y \implies \boxed{x = 0 \lor y = 0}$$
> Consequently,
> $$\boxed{x \cdot y = x \cdot z \quad \land \quad x \neq 0 \quad \implies \quad y = z}$$

Because of the above proposition, domains are said to **satisfy the _cancellation law_**.

> [!definition] Definition 7.2.4: Field
> Let $(R, +, \cdot)$ be a commutative ring such that $R^* = R \setminus \{0\}$.
> Then $(R, +, \cdot)$ is called a **field**.

_Why are fields always integral domains?_

> Assume that $(R, +, \cdot)$ is a field and let $x, y \in R$ such that $$x \cdot y = 0$$If $x \neq 0$, then $x$ is a unit (by definition of a field) and thus has a multiplicative inverse $x^{-1}$. Multiplying both sides of the equation $x \cdot y = 0$ by $x^{-1}$ gives $$x^{-1} \cdot (x \cdot y) = x^{-1} \cdot 0 \implies 1 \cdot y = 0 \implies y = 0.$$Because there exists no $y \neq 0$ such that $x \cdot y = 0$, we conclude that $x$ is not a zero-divisor. By symmetry, the same argument applies if $y \neq 0$. Therefore, a field has no zero-divisors and is thus an integral domain.

> [!defintion] Finite field
> A **finite field** is a field with a finite number of elements.

**WARNING**:$$(\Z_n, +_n, \cdot_n) \text{ is a field} \iff n \text{ is a prime number.}$$
