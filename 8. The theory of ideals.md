## 8.1 Ring homomorphisms and ideals

From now on, we will only consider **commutative rings**.

Ideals in ring theory play a similar role as normal subgroups in group theory and are used to construct **quotient rings**.

We have seen that $\text{ker}(\varphi)$ of a group homomorphism $\varphi: G_1 \to G_2$ is a **normal** subgroup of $G_1$. That's why we start by studying ring homomorphisms and their kernels.

A rich source of ring homomorphisms comes from the evaluation of polynomials of subrings $R \subseteq S$ in points of the larger rings $S$.

In such a setting, a polynomial $p(X) \in R[X]$ is also a polynomial in $S[X]$. Thus, we can define the evaluation of $p(X)$ at a point $a \in S$.

_Example_: $\Z$ is a subring of $(\R, +, \cdot)$. Because a polynomial $p(X) \in \Z[X]$ is also a polynomial in $\R[X]$, we can define the evaluation of $p(X)$ at a point $a \in \R$.

_Example_: $R = \Z$ is a subring of $(S, +, \cdot) = (\C, +, \cdot)$. Choosing $a = \sqrt{2} \in \C$, we get the ring homomorphism
$$\psi : \begin{cases}\Z[X] \to \C\\ p(X) \mapsto p(\sqrt{2})\end{cases}$$which is not a ring isomorphism since it is not injective ($\psi(2)=2=\psi(X^2)$).

By Theorem 6.1.9, $\ker(\varphi)$ is a **normal** subgroup of the group $(R, +_R)$. However, by the definition of a ring (Definition 7.1.1), $(R, +_R)$ is an **abelian** group, so every subgroup of $(R, +_R)$ is automatically normal. Thus, we conclude that $\ker(\varphi)$ is a subgroup of $(R, +_R)$.

> [!theorem] Theorem 8.1.6: Properties of the kernel of a ring homomorphism

So the ideal is closed under multiplication. That is to say, if $x,r \in I$, then $x \cdot_R r \in I$, but it is in general much stronger since $r$ can be any element of the ring $R$, not necessarily an element of the ideal $I$.

> [!deduction] The kernel of a ring homomorphism is an ideal
> Let $\varphi: R \to S$ be a ring homomorphism. Then its kernel $\ker(\varphi)$ is an ideal of the ring $R$.

**Trivial ideals** of the commutative ring $(R, +, \cdot)$ are $\{0_R\}$ and $R$ itself.
In fact, these trivial ideals are **principal ideals**, since $\{0_R\} = \gen{0_R}$ and $R = \gen{1_R}$:

It turns out that any ideal in the ring $(\Z_6, +_6, \cdot_6)$ is a principal ideal. Langrange's theorem says that the subgroup $I \subseteq (\Z_6, +_6)$ has order $|I|$ dividing $6$. Thus, $|I| \in \{1,2,3,6\}$. The subgroups of these orders are $\{0\}$, $\{0,3\}$, $\{0,2,4\}$ and $\Z_6$ itself. One can check that these are also ideals of the ring $(\Z_6, +_6, \cdot_6)$:

-   $\{0\} = \gen{0}$
-   $\{0,3\} = \gen{3}$
-   $\{0,2,4\} = \gen{2}$
-   $\Z_6 = \gen{1}$

An example of a principal ideal ring is $(\Z_6, +_6, \cdot_6)$

> [!lemma] Lemma 8.1.15

Since 5 and 7 are relatively prime and thus $\text{gcd}(5,7) = 1$, we have that $\gen{5,7} = \gen{1} = \Z$. This means that every integer can be written as a linear combination of 5 and 7:
$$\forall k \in \Z, \exists a,b \in \Z: k = 5a + 7b.$$
For example, $1 = 5 \cdot (-4) + 7 \cdot 3$.

In fact, in the next section, we will see that **any ideal $I\subseteq \Z$** is a **principal** ideal, i.e. $$\exists n \in \Z : I = \gen{n}$$.
