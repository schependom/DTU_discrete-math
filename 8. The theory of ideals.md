## 8.1 Ring homomorphisms and ideals

From now on, we will only consider **commutative rings**.

Ideals in ring theory play a similar role as normal subgroups in group theory and are used to construct **quotient rings**.

We have seen that $\text{ker}(\varphi)$ of a group homomorphism $\varphi: G_1 \to G_2$ is a **normal** subgroup of $G_1$. That's why we start by studying ring homomorphisms and their kernels.

>
> 2. $\varphi(1_R) = 1_S$
> 3. $\varphi(r \cdot_R s) = \varphi(r) \cdot_S \varphi(s)$ for all $r, s \in R$

**Example**: $\psi : \begin{cases}\Z \to \Zn\\ a \mapsto a \mod n\end{cases} \,$ is a ring homomorphism from $(\Z, +, \cdot)$ to $(\Zn, +_n, \cdot_n)$.

It says that you can perform the addition and multiplication operations before or after taking the modulus, and the result is the same. We already saw this in Corollary 1.3.8:
$$\forall a,b \in \Z: a +_n b = (a + b) \bmod n = ((a \bmod n) + (b \bmod n)) \bmod n$$
Which is equivalent to
$$\psi(a + b) = \psi(a) +_n \psi(b).$$
Similarly for multiplication:
$$\forall a,b \in \Z: a \cdot_n b = (a \cdot b) \bmod n = ((a \bmod n) \cdot (b \bmod n)) \bmod n$$
Which is equivalent to
$$\psi(a \cdot b) = \psi(a) \cdot_n \psi(b).$$

> [!definition] Ring Isomorphism
> A **ring isomorphism** is a **bijective** ring homomorphism $\varphi: R \to S$.

A rich source of ring homomorphisms comes from the evaluation of polynomials of subrings $R \subseteq S$ in points of the larger rings $S$.

> [!definition] Definition: Subring
> Let $(S, +, \cdot)$ be a ring. Then $R$ is a **subring** of $S$ if
>
> -   $R \subseteq S$
> -   $0_R = 0_S$
> -   $1_R = 1_S$
> -   we restrict the operations $+$ and $\cdot$ of $S$ to $R$, making $(R, +, \cdot)$ a ring.

In such a setting, a polynomial $p(X) \in R[X]$ is also a polynomial in $S[X]$. Thus, we can define the evaluation of $p(X)$ at a point $a \in S$.

_Example_: $\Z$ is a subring of $(\R, +, \cdot)$. Because a polynomial $p(X) \in \Z[X]$ is also a polynomial in $\R[X]$, we can define the evaluation of $p(X)$ at a point $a \in \R$.

> [!proposition] Proposition 8.1.2
> Let $R$ be a subring of $S$. Then for any $a \in S$, the map
> $$\psi : \begin{cases}R[X] \to S\\ p(X) \mapsto p(a)\end{cases}$$
> is a **ring homomorphism**.

_Example_: $R = \Z$ is a subring of $(S, +, \cdot) = (\C, +, \cdot)$. Choosing $a = \sqrt{2} \in \C$, we get the ring homomorphism
$$\psi : \begin{cases}\Z[X] \to \C\\ p(X) \mapsto p(\sqrt{2})\end{cases}$$which is not a ring isomorphism since it is not injective ($\psi(2)=2=\psi(X^2)$).

> [!definition] Definition 8.1.4: Kernel of a ring homomorphism

> \text{ker}(\varphi) = \{r \in R \mid \varphi(r) = 0_S\}.

By Theorem 6.1.9, $\ker(\varphi)$ is a **normal** subgroup of the group $(R, +_R)$. However, by the definition of a ring (Definition 7.1.1), $(R, +_R)$ is an **abelian** group, so every subgroup of $(R, +_R)$ is automatically normal. Thus, we conclude that $\ker(\varphi)$ is a subgroup of $(R, +_R)$.

> [!theorem] Theorem 8.1.6: Properties of the kernel of a ring homomorphism
> Let $\varphi: R \to S$ be a ring homomorphism. Then its kernel $\ker(\varphi)$ has the following properties:
>
> 1. $\ker(\varphi) \subseteq R$ is a (normal) **subgroup** of the **additive group** $(R, +_R)$ of the ring $R$.
> 2. $\forall r \in R, \forall x \in \ker(\varphi): \quad \boxed{r \cdot_R x \in \ker(\varphi)}.$

> [!definition] Definition 8.1.7: Ideal
> Let $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ be a _commutative ring_. A subset $I \subseteq R$ is an **ideal** of $R$ if
>
> 1. $I \subseteq R$ is a **subgroup** of the **additive group** $(R, +_R)$.
> 2. $\forall r \in R, \forall x \in I: \quad \boxed{r \cdot_R x \in I}.$

So the ideal is closed under multiplication. That is to say, if $x,r \in I$, then $x \cdot_R r \in I$, but it is in general much stronger since $r$ can be any element of the ring $R$, not necessarily an element of the ideal $I$.

> [!fact] Every ideal contains $0_R$
> Let $I$ be an ideal of a commutative ring $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$. Then
> $$\boxed{0_R \in I}$$

This is because $I$ is a subgroup of the group $(R, +_R)$, and thus contains the identity element $0_R$ of this group.

> [!exercise] Exercise 8.10: Intersection of Ideals
> The **intersection** $I \cap J$ of two ideals $I,J$ of a commutative ring $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ is again an **ideal** of $R$.

However, the union $I \cup J$ of two ideals $I,J$ of a commutative ring $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ is in general **not** an ideal of $R$.
Consider, for example, $I = 2\Z = \gen{2}$ and $J = 3\Z = \gen{3}$, which are both ideals of the ring $(\Z, +, \cdot)$. Now, it holds that $2 \in I$ and $3 \in J$, but $2 + 3 = 5 \notin I \cup J$. Thus, $I \cup J$ is not closed under addition and therefore not an ideal of $(\Z, +, \cdot)$ (it is not even a subgroup of $(\Z, +)$).

> [!deduction] The kernel of a ring homomorphism is an ideal
> Let $\varphi: R \to S$ be a ring homomorphism. Then its kernel $\ker(\varphi)$ is an ideal of the ring $R$.

**Trivial ideals** of the commutative ring $(R, +, \cdot)$ are $\{0_R\}$ and $R$ itself.
In fact, these trivial ideals are **principal ideals**, since $\{0_R\} = \gen{0_R}$ and $R = \gen{1_R}$:

> [!exercise] Exercise 8.6
> If an ideal $I \subseteq R$ contains a **unit** $u \in R^*$, then $I = R$.
>
> $$
> \exists u \in R^* : \boxed{u \in I \implies I = R}
> $$

For example, if $1_R \in I$, then for any $r \in R$, we have that $r = r \cdot_R 1_R \in I$ by the definition of an ideal. Thus, $I = R$.
So, if we want to find non-trivial ideals, we have to look for ideals that **do not contain any units**.

The proof of the more general case for any unit $u \in R^*$ is as follows: assume that $u \in I$ then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\forall r \in R : r \cdot u^{-1} \in R \quad &\implies r \cdot u^{-1} \cdot u \in I && \text{(by definition of ideal, since $u \in I$)}\\
&\implies r \in I && \text{(since $u^{-1} \cdot u = 1_R$)}
\end{aligned}
$$

It turns out that any ideal in the ring $(\Z_6, +_6, \cdot_6)$ is a principal ideal. Langrange's theorem says that the subgroup $I \subseteq (\Z_6, +_6)$ has order $|I|$ dividing $6$. Thus, $|I| \in \{1,2,3,6\}$. The subgroups of these orders are $\{0\}$, $\{0,3\}$, $\{0,2,4\}$ and $\Z_6$ itself. One can check that these are also ideals of the ring $(\Z_6, +_6, \cdot_6)$:

-   $\{0\} = \gen{0}$
-   $\{0,3\} = \gen{3}$
-   $\{0,2,4\} = \gen{2}$
-   $\Z_6 = \gen{1}$

-   An example of a principal ideal ring is $(\Z_6, +_6, \cdot_6)$
-   Consider the ring $(\Z, +, \cdot)$. Then the congruence class $n\Z$ is a principal ideal of $(\Z, +, \cdot)$ generated by $n$:
    $$
    \gen{n} = n\Z = \{\ldots, -2n, -n, 0, n, 2n, \ldots\}.
    $$

> [!lemma] Lemma 8.1.15 (p166)

Since 5 and 7 are relatively prime and thus $\text{gcd}(5,7) = 1$, we have that $\gen{5,7} = \gen{1} = \Z$. This means that every integer can be written as a linear combination of 5 and 7:
$$\forall k \in \Z, \exists a,b \in \Z: k = 5a + 7b.$$
For example, $1 = 5 \cdot (-4) + 7 \cdot 3$.

In fact, in the next section, we will see that **any ideal $I\subseteq \Z$** is a **principal** ideal, i.e. $$\exists n \in \Z : I = \gen{n}$$.

## 8.2 Principal ideal domains

> The ring $(\Z, +, \cdot)$ of integers is a **principal ideal domain** (PID)

Given a concrete ideal, how to find its generator $x$? Page 167 gives the answer. We summarize it here:

## 8.3 Quotient rings

In group theory, we considered **normal** subgroups in order to construct **quotient groups**. In ring theory, we will consider **ideals** in order to construct **quotient rings**.

> [!definition] Cosets of an ideal
> Since an ideal $I$ of the ring $(R, +, \cdot)$ is by definition a _subgroup_ of the _additive group_ $(R, +)$, we can define cosets of $I$ in $R$ by $r$ as:$$r+I = \{r + x \mid x \in I\}$$

Recall that any $r_1 \in r+I$ is called a **representative** of that coset. We have that $r_1 + I = r + I$, because

-   $r_1 \in r_1 + I = \{r_1 + x \mid x \in I\}$ because $0_R \in I$
-   **cosets are either equal or disjoint** (Theorem 4.3.4)

$$\boxed{r_1 \in r + I \implies r_1 + I = r + I}$$

Also recall that two cosets $fH$ and $gH$ are equal $\Leftrightarrow$ $f^{-1}g \in H$ (Theorem 4.3.3). In the case of ideals, this means that two cosets $r + I$ and $s + I$ are equal if
$$\boxed{r+I = s+I \iff r - s \in I}$$

Furthermore, since $(R, +)$ is an **abelian** group, the left coset $r + I$ is equal to the right coset $I + r$ for any $r \in R$. This implies that $I$ is a **normal subgroup of $R$** and therefore we can define the **quotient group** $(R/I, +)$ with addition defined by
$$\boxed{(r + I) + (s + I) := (r + s) + I}.$$

> [!lemma] Lemma 8.3.1 (p169)
> Let $I \subseteq R$ be an ideal of the commutative ring $(R, +, \cdot)$. Then the following operation on cosets is well defined:
> $$\boxed{(r + I) \cdot (s + I) := (r \cdot s) + I}$$

Now we give the set $R/I$ of all cosets of the ideal $I$ in $R$ the structure of a ring by defining addition and multiplication of cosets:

> [!theorem] Theorem 8.3.2: quotient ring (p170)
> Let $I \subseteq R$ be an ideal of the commutative ring $(R, +, \cdot)$. Then

> \begin{align}
> (r + I) + (s + I) &:= (r + s) + I \\
> (r + I) \cdot (s + I) &:= (r \cdot s) + I

> $$
>
> is a commutative ring with zero element $0_R + I$ and unit element $1_R + I$.
> This ring is called the **quotient ring** of $R$ by the ideal $I$.

> [!theorem] Theorem 8.3.5 (p171)
> Let $\psi : R \to S$ be a ring homomorphism between rings $(R, +_R, \cdot_R)$ and $(S, +_S, \cdot_S)$.
