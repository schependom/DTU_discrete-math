### Proof
The proof is done by rearrangement of four right-angled triangles with sides a, b, and c into two different squares. This method is often attributed to the Indian mathematician Bhaskara II.

Let's consider a square with side length $(a+b)$. The area is $(a+b)^2$.

We can arrange the four triangles inside this square, leaving a smaller square in the middle with side length $c$.

Area of outer square = Area of 4 triangles + Area of inner square
$(a+b)^2 = 4(\frac{1}{2}ab) + c^2$
$a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2$
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

$$\blacksquare$$
